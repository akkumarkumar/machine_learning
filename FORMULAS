IN THIS WE WOULD NOT SEE ANY CODING IT'S JUST A SET OF FORMULAS WE WOULD BE USING IN REGRESSION

*here xs and ys refers to the points chossen to make a line e.g xs = 2,3,4,5 and ys = 5,6,7,8
*so points are (2,5) , (3,6) ..... etc it's because points are mentioned in (x,y) according to co-ordinate geometry


1.m =(mean(xs)*mean(ys)) - (mean(xs*ys)) / (mean(xs)**2) - mean(xs)**2 ----> to find slope of line
       
2.c = (mean(ys)) - m*mean(xs) -----> to find y-intercept

3.squared_error = (ys_line - ys_orig)**2

4. R^2 = 1 - squared_error of y's mean line / squared_error of y's regression line

5. equation of line = y = mx + c
